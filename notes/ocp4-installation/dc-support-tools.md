To perform `oc adm debug node` in a restricted network, copy these support tools images from upstream to your mirror Docker repository:
* registry.redhat.io/rhel7/support-tools
* quay.io/openshift/origin-must-gather

Then, configure an ImageContentSourcePolicy to access these images from your mirror repository.  Create a local file named `support-tools-policy.yaml` and replace `<local-registry>:<local-port>` with your mirror repository:
```
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: support-tools-policy
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - <local-registry>:<local-port>/rhel7/support-tools
    source: registry.redhat.io/rhel7/support-tools
  - mirrors:
    - <local-registry>:<local-port>/openshift/origin-must-gather
    source: quay.io/openshift/origin-must-gather
```

Apply the policy to your cluster, and wait for the nodes to reboot: `oc apply -f support-tools-policy.yaml`
