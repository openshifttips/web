Commands to mirror registry for a disconnected cluster:

```bash
export OCP_RELEASE=4.6.2                 ### replace with your minor version
export LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>'
export LOCAL_REPOSITORY='ocp-release' 
export PRODUCT_REPO='openshift-release-dev' 
export LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='pull-secret'   ### this should contain auth creds to your registry 
export RELEASE_NAME='ocp-release'
export ARCHITECTURE=x86_64

# mirror contents to external repository (for both new cluster and upgrades)
oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} \
  --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} \
  --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
  --apply-release-image-signature \
  --insecure=true

# build openshift-install for mirror registry (new cluster only)
oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release extract --command=openshift-install "${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}" --insecure=true
```

Commands to upgrade a disconnected cluster:

```bash
# first find the digest SHA for the appropriate version
oc adm release info 4.6.2

# you can also navigate to this URL for the same information
http://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.6.2/release.txt

# upgrade cluster based on digest, replacing the SHA with the one from the link above
oc adm upgrade --to-image="${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:f34d1f14b17d5a469de41807bc0a8a87e473d38f85557de4b985763e26bab520" --allow-explicit-upgrade --force

# watch the cluster version upgrade
oc get events -n openshift-cluster-version -w
```
